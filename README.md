# Genetic Algorithm
##  Implementation of genetic algorithm to solve 8 Queens problem.
A genetic algorithm is used to solve complicated problems with a greater number of variables & possible outcomes/solutions.<br>
One such problem is '8 Queens' puzzle. The objective here is to place 8 queens on a Chess board of dimension 8x8 such that they don't threaten each other i.e. no 2 queens share the same row, column and diagonal.<br>
